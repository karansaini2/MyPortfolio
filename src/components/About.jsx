          I'm a web developer and spend my time working with many different
          aspects of the web like front end (HTML,CSS,Javascript,React-Js). Iâ€™m
          extremely passionate about web development and taking my skills to the
          next level is something I do every day. Aside from web development,I
          enjoy to sing and listen to music. My belief that every moment of life
          teaches us a new lesson and gives us the chance of upgrading to the
          better version of our's.
